------------------------
**Red** is a new programming language strongly inspired by [Rebol](http://rebol.com), but with a broader field of usage thanks to its native-code compiler, from system programming to high-level scripting, while providing modern support for concurrency and multi-core CPUs.

Red has its own complete cross-platform toolchain, featuring two compilers, an interpreter and a linker, not depending on any third-party library, except for a Rebol2 interpreter, required during the bootstrap phase. Once complete, Red will be [self-hosted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting).

The Red software stack also contains another language, **Red/System**, which is a low-level dialect of Red. It is a limited C-level language with a Red look'n feel, required to build Red's runtime library and be the target language of Red's compiler.
